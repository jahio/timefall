#
# To specify dates, use the format YYYY-MM-DD. If you need a time on that date, use
# 24-hour format WITHOUT a time zone and wrap it in double quotes. For example, 9PM
# on March 5, 1770 would be "1770-03-05 21:00:00" (the Boston Massacre). The date/time
# stuff is a limitation of JavaScript's ability to convert the string into a native
# date object, not YAML or this project/tool.
#
# The order in which you specify the events here, so long as the time formatting is
# correct as are the dates themselves, doesn't matter. The timeline will sort them
# for you automatically. That's the reason for calling out the specific formatting
# of the date/time string.
