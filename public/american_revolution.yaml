title: The American Revolution
intro: |
  Spanning roughly a quarter of the planet, lasting more than thirteen years
  and involving at least three major European powers, the American Revolution
  was a wildly complex historical flashpoint that forever changed the
  long-term trajectory of human history. The following timeline, while most
  certainly **far from exhaustive**, is a sampling of some of those events
  that I've personally assembled relevant to my first novel: an historical
  fiction piece set in that era. Writing such a work necessarily entails
  forming a detailed understanding of the context, events, issues, cultures,
  and peoples who shaped the period, the conflict, and ultimately, our world.

  **NOTE:** This timeline is a work in progress and is incomplete.

  **CAUTION:** Some of this timeline is AI-generated. Fact-checking is strongly advised.
