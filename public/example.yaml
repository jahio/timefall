# This is an experiment for a personal project I'm working on. The below is a YAML representation of some of the historical
# events that occurred relating to the American Revolution. It is absolutely incomplete and not intended to be a history lesson
# or a political statement. I'll probably add to and tweak this as I go, expanding on my experiement in multiple ways,
# but be aware that this is just used as test data for a personal project that I hope to be able to let others use one day,
# if it turns out well.
#
# (Said project is an attempt at creating an HTML/CSS/JS interactive timeline in the browser. The idea: don't worry about
# messing with front-end code, just feed it some nice and easy YAML - like this - of historical events and data and you
# get a nice and pretty interactive, navigable timeline of events that you can use as a research aid, reference material, etc.
# Could be a good tool for students, authors, historians, teachers, college professors, whomever!)
#
# Be advised: These events may be INTENTIONALLY out of chronological order and the date format may be INTENTIONALLY
# inconsistent. That's by design: I want the end user to be able to make minor human mistakes and the software to still
# work as expected, so I test for that in my own experience by screwing up on purpose.
#
# To format and lint this document, try https://github.com/google/yamlfmt
#   One of the very few times you'll see me recommend anything with the taint of Google on it, but
#   as of this writing, it's a decent tool. Pay attention to the options in $PWD/.yamlfmt.
#
#   $ brew install yamlfmt
#   $ cd path/to/this/repo/public
#   $ yamlfmt ./example.yaml
#

#
# To specify dates, use the format YYYY-MM-DD. If you need a time on that date, use
# 24-hour format WITHOUT a time zone and wrap it in double quotes. For example, 9PM
# on March 5, 1770 would be "1770-03-05 21:00:00" (the Boston Massacre).
#
# The order in which you specify the events here, so long as the time formatting is
# correct as are the dates themselves, doesn't matter. The timeline will sort them
# for you automatically. That's the reason for calling out the specific formatting
# of the date/time string.

  title: The American Revolution
  intro: |
    Spanning roughly a quarter of the planet, lasting more than thirteen years
    and involving at least three major European powers, the American Revolution
    was a wildly complex historical flashpoint that forever changed the
    long-term trajectory of human history. The following timeline, while most
    certainly **far from exhaustive**, is a sampling of some of those events
    that I've personally assembled relevant to my first novel: an historical
    fiction piece set in that era. Writing such a work necessarily entails
    forming a detailed understanding of the context, events, issues, cultures,
    and peoples who shaped the period, the conflict, and ultimately, our world.

    **BE ADVISED**: Much of the below was AI-generated, just to short-cut the
    process of discovering what to focus on and build the list _of_. All of it
    should be thoroughly fact-checked, and the online sources, while provided by
    ChatGPT4 at the time of generation, may have been moved, altered or deleted
    between when it ingested them into its training database and when you check
    them. Additionally, it is entirely possible that it has mis-quoted and/or
    misunderstood the provided book references as well, so treat everything with
    a grain of salt until you can prove everything here is true. I'll be fact
    checking this for myself as I go along.

    # 1770
    - title: "Boston Massacre"
      date: "1770-03-05"
      description: "Confrontation between British soldiers and Boston civilians that resulted in five deaths."
      body: |
        Tensions had been escalating between British troops stationed in Boston and the
        local populace. On March 5, a confrontation outside the Custom House turned violent
        when British soldiers fired into a crowd, killing five men. This incident, heavily
        publicized by colonial activists like Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, was dubbed the
        "Boston Massacre". It became a significant propaganda tool, galvanizing colonial
        sentiment against British authority and military presence.

      date: "1770-04-12"
      description: "British Parliament repeals most of the Townshend Acts."
      body: |
        In response to growing colonial unrest and economic disruptions caused by
        boycotts, the British Parliament decided to repeal most of the duties imposed
        by the Townshend Acts. Charles Townshend's initiative had levied taxes on various
        goods imported into the colonies, including tea. With the 1770 repeal, all duties
        were lifted except for the one on tea. This partial concession did little to ease
        tensions, as the retained tax on tea would later lead to the famous Boston Tea
        Party.

      date: "1771-05-16"
      description: "Conflict between local militia and regulators in North Carolina."
      body: |
        The Battle of Alamance was the culmination of growing tensions in North Carolina
        between colonists, particularly backcountry farmers known as the Regulators, and
        the colonial British government. The Regulators were protesting what they saw as
        corrupt practices by local officials and excessive taxation. On May 16, a militia
        under the command of Governor William Tryon confronted the Regulators. The battle
        lasted two hours, and the Regulators were ultimately defeated. Though not directly
        a precursor to the Revolutionary War, it reflected the growing tensions and
        anti-authoritarian sentiments present in the colonies.

      description: "Continued westward expansion and settlement by American colonists."
      body: |
        Throughout 1771, as in preceding years, there was a continued push by American
        colonists to expand and settle in the westward territories. While this might not
        represent a single event, the ongoing movement and settlement led to multiple
        skirmishes with Native American tribes and tensions with colonial governments.
        This westward drive exemplified the independent spirit of the colonists and their
        desire for land and opportunity, setting the stage for later territorial disputes
        and emphasizing the distinct identity developing in the American colonies.

      description: "Attack on the British customs schooner, HMS Gaspee, by American colonists."
      body: |
        The Gaspee Affair was a significant pre-Revolutionary incident between the British and American colonists. HMS Gaspee, a British customs schooner, had been successful in enforcing navigation laws, but its methods angered local merchants. When the ship ran aground in Rhode Island waters, a group of colonists led by Abraham Whipple and John Brown boarded it and set it on fire. The incident increased tensions between the American colonies and Britain, especially when it became clear that no one would be held accountable for the act.

      date: "1772-11-02"
      description: "Samuel Adams called for a Committee of Correspondence in Boston."
      body: |
        The Committee of Correspondence was initially formed in Boston under the guidance of Samuel Adams. These committees aimed to maintain communication between patriot leaders in different colonies, sharing news about British actions and discussing possible collective responses. The model quickly spread, and by the next year, many other colonies formed their own Committees of Correspondence. They played a significant role in unifying the colonies and providing a foundation for the organized resistance against Britain.

      body: |
        The Somerset case was a landmark judgment in England. James Somerset, an enslaved African taken to England by his American owner, had escaped but was recaptured and slated for deportation and sale in the colonies. Advocates for Somerset's freedom brought the case before the courts. Lord Chief Justice Mansfield ruled that while colonial laws might permit slavery, no law in England explicitly did. As a result, Somerset was freed. The case didn't abolish slavery in the British Empire but was a significant step toward that end and had profound effects on both sides of the Atlantic.

      date: "1773-12-16"
      description: "Political protest where American colonists dumped tea into the Boston Harbor."
      body: |
        The Boston Tea Party was a direct response to the Tea Act imposed by the
        British government. Colonists, frustrated with the lack of
        representation in Parliament and the continued taxation, chose to
        protest by boarding British ships and dumping an entire shipment of tea
        into the harbor. This act of defiance further escalated tensions between
        the colonies and the British government, leading to a series of punitive
        measures known as the Intolerable Acts.

      date: "1773-05-10"
      description: "British Act granting the East India Company the right to directly ship its tea to North America."
      body: |
        The Tea Act of 1773 was a regulatory motion by the British government
        intended not only to save the struggling East India Company from
        bankruptcy but also to establish a precedent for the right to tax the
        colonies. The act allowed the company to ship tea directly to the
        colonies, bypassing colonial merchants and undercutting their prices.
        While it effectively reduced the price of tea, it was seen by many
        colonists as a cunning tactic to get them to accept the principle of
        Parliamentary taxation.

      description: "Series of punitive laws passed by the British Parliament in response to the Boston Tea Party."
      body: |
        The Intolerable Acts, known as the Coercive Acts in Britain, were a set of laws designed to punish the Massachusetts colonists for their defiance in the Boston Tea Party protest. The series of laws closed the Boston Harbor until the dumped tea was paid for, revoked the Massachusetts Charter, allowed royal officers to be tried in other colonies or England if accused of crimes, and expanded the Quartering Act to allow British troops to lodge in private homes. These acts galvanized colonial opposition and were instrumental in the convening of the First Continental Congress later that year.

      body: |
        In response to the Intolerable Acts, 56 delegates from all colonies except Georgia met in Philadelphia for the First Continental Congress. The congress aimed to outline colonial grievances, develop a response, and establish a unified American position. By the end of their deliberations, they had adopted the Declaration and Resolves which opposed the Coercive Acts and called for their repeal, set up a boycott of British goods, and endorsed the concept of colonial self-governance.

      body: |
        The Quebec Act was part of a series of efforts by the British Parliament to deal with the aftermath of the French and Indian War. It extended the boundaries of Quebec and granted religious freedom to Catholics in the province. While the act was not punitive in nature, American colonists interpreted it as a threat. They feared the establishment of Catholicism in Quebec, and the extension of its territory southward was seen as encroaching upon the colonies. Many colonists grouped this act with the Coercive Acts as another example of British tyranny.

        Tensions were high after the passage of the Coercive Acts. When the British military, fearing an uprising, moved to seize gunpowder from a magazine in Somerville, Massachusetts, it prompted widespread alarm. Although no battle occurred, this event further inflamed anti-British sentiments. The massive colonial response, with thousands rallying and preparing for conflict, made it clear that the American colonies were on the brink of revolution.

        The battles of Lexington and Concord marked the start of the

        confiscate weapons in Concord and arrest revolutionaries. They clashed
        with local militias, leading to casualties on both sides. These battles

        After the confrontations at Lexington and Concord, militia forces from

        troops. The siege lasted for almost a year, with both sides facing
        hardships. The culmination of this siege was the British evacuation in
        March 1776, marking a significant victory for the American forces.

        inflicted significant losses on the British, proving their resolve and

        The Continental Army, seeing an opportunity to bring Canada into the

        The force, under the command of Generals Richard Montgomery and
        Benedict Arnold, faced hardships from the outset, battling rough
        terrain, cold weather, and disease. Though they did achieve early
        successes, capturing Montreal, the final assault on Quebec City on
        December 31, 1775, ended in failure and the eventual retreat of the
        American forces.

        foundational document declared the thirteen American colonies independent from
        British rule. The Declaration enumerated the colonies' grievances against King
        George III and asserted their natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of

        As part of a strategy to capture Philadelphia, British forces under General
        William Howe faced off against George Washington's troops. The Battle of
        Brandywine on September 11 was a British victory, allowing Howe to take
        Philadelphia by month's end. In response, Washington attempted a surprise attack
        in October at Germantown, but it ultimately failed. Despite these setbacks, the
        American resolve remained unbroken.

        After the British capture of Philadelphia, Washington's troops wintered at Valley
        Forge. During these challenging six months, the Continental Army faced extreme
        cold, hunger, and disease. However, under the training of Baron von Steuben, a
        Prussian military officer, the army emerged from the winter as a more cohesive
        and disciplined force, better prepared for the challenges of the upcoming
        campaigns.

        Following the American victory at Saratoga in 1777, France recognized the

        Treaty of Alliance and the Treaty of Amity and Commerce were signed on February 6,
        1778. This was a significant turning point, as French military and financial
        support greatly boosted the American war effort against Britain.

        aimed to leverage Loyalist support to reclaim the rebellious colonies one by one.
        The campaign began with the capture of Savannah, Georgia, late in the year, laying

        siege to the city and its American defenders led by General Benjamin Lincoln.
        After six weeks of siege operations, and facing heavy artillery fire and
        a tightening blockade, Lincoln was compelled to surrender. The loss of
        Charleston and its significant garrison was a severe blow to the American

#     description: Colonial forces, occupying hills surrounding the city, sought to countrol Boston harbor. In response, the British attacked to dislodge them from their defensible positions.
#     body: |
#       Colonial leaders had become aware of a British plan to occupy hills surrounding Boston to further solidify their control
#       over the harbor and the overall region. To beat them to the punch, they pre-emptively did the same, sending troops to occupy
#       and fortify those same hills before the British were able to do so. In response, the British launched a massive attack on those
#       same hills in several waves that only succeeded because colonial forces literally ran out of ammunition. The British won a tactical
#       victory, but at a very high loss: they had incurred massive casualties, far more than the American forces had, making their
#       success, arguably, a phyrric victory.

#           On June 13, 1775, Colonial forces learned of a British plan to occupy and entrench defensible positions on
#           elevated hills (high ground) surrounding Boston that would ultimately reinforce their dominance over Boston and
#           its harbor, a vital supply port for their ongoing occupation of the colonies.

#         body: |
#           Four days later, the British launched their attack on those fortified positions in an attempt to re-take them by
#           any means necessary. After several waves of attackers assaulted American fortifications and failed, finally the
#           American forces had literally run out of ammunition to fire. One story claims that Dr. Joseph Warren stood his
#           ground at the scene to give militia a chance to escape, knowing himself to be what we'd today call an "HVT" or
#           "high value target" to the British, and remained with nothing more than his spent rifle (likely with a bayonet
#           attached) to engage in combat with the British should they get close enough. Whether true or not, a fact not
#           in dispute is that Joseph Warren was killed in action on this day by a British officer who recognized him (or,
#           potentially, an officer's aide who knew his face and alerted others to his status as an HVT on scene). It's said
#           that he was so reviled that several individuals repeatedly stabbed and mutilated his corpse to the point of being
#           unrecognizable, and one account claims they went so far as to literally decapitate his lifeless body after the
#           fact. His remains were identified by Paul Revere - a known friend - due to a false tooth he was known to have.
#           Warren's death served as a form of martyrdom for the American cause, galvanizing people far and wide for the
#           long and challenging conflict to come.
