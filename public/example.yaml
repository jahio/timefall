# This is an experiment for a personal project I'm working on. The below is a YAML representation of some of the historical
# events that occurred relating to the American Revolution. It is absolutely incomplete and not intended to be a history lesson
# or a political statement. I'll probably add to and tweak this as I go, expanding on my experiement in multiple ways,
# but be aware that this is just used as test data for a personal project that I hope to be able to let others use one day,
# if it turns out well.
#
# (Said project is an attempt at creating an HTML/CSS/JS interactive timeline in the browser. The idea: don't worry about
# messing with front-end code, just feed it some nice and easy YAML - like this - of historical events and data and you
# get a nice and pretty interactive, navigable timeline of events that you can use as a research aid, reference material, etc.
# Could be a good tool for students, authors, historians, teachers, college professors, whomever!)
#
# Be advised: These events may be INTENTIONALLY out of chronological order and the date format may be INTENTIONALLY
# inconsistent. That's by design: I want the end user to be able to make minor human mistakes and the software to still
# work as expected, so I test for that in my own experience by screwing up on purpose.
#
# To format and lint this document, try https://github.com/google/yamlfmt
#   One of the very few times you'll see me recommend anything with the taint of Google on it, but
#   as of this writing, it's a decent tool. Pay attention to the options in $PWD/.yamlfmt.
#
#   $ brew install yamlfmt
#   $ cd path/to/this/repo/public
#   $ yamlfmt ./example.yaml
#

#
# To specify dates, use the format YYYY-MM-DD. If you need a time on that date, use
# 24-hour format WITHOUT a time zone and wrap it in double quotes. For example, 9PM
# on March 5, 1770 would be "1770-03-05 21:00:00" (the Boston Massacre).
#
# The order in which you specify the events here, so long as the time formatting is
# correct as are the dates themselves, doesn't matter. The timeline will sort them
# for you automatically. That's the reason for calling out the specific formatting
# of the date/time string.

  title: The American Revolution
  intro: |
    Spanning roughly a quarter of the planet, lasting more than thirteen years and involving at least three major
    European powers, the American Revolution was a wildly complex historical flashpoint that forever changed
    the long-term trajectory of human history. The following timeline, while most certainly **far from exhaustive**,
    is a sampling of some of those events that I've personally assembled relevant to my first novel: an historical fiction
    piece set in that era. Writing such a work necessarily entails forming a detailed understanding of the context, events,
    issues, cultures, and peoples who shaped the period, the conflict, and ultimately, our world.
  events:
    - title: "Battle of Lexington and Concord"
      date: "1775-04-19"
      description: "First military engagements of the Revolutionary War between British soldiers and American colonists."
      body: |
        The battles of Lexington and Concord marked the start of the Revolutionary War. British troops were dispatched
        from Boston to confiscate weapons in Concord and arrest revolutionaries. They clashed with local militias,
        leading to casualties on both sides.
      actions:
        - date: "1775-04-19"

            At Lexington, the British confronted a group of Minutemen, leading to a brief skirmish. In Concord, the
            British faced more significant resistance and eventually began their retreat back to Boston, facing
            guerilla-style attacks along the way.
